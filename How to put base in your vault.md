Both the notes and the base need to be put in your vault folder.

You can find your vault folder by clicking "manage vault" and then "reveal vault in system explorer".

The base can just be put into your vault. For the notes I made a zip-file. Make a new folder in your system and unzip it in there, because I don't think 231 loose notes in your vault is something you guys would want to deal with. 

Good luck!
