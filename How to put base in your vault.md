Both the notes and the base need to be put in your vault folder.

You can find your vault folder by clicking "manage vault" and then "reveal vault in system explorer". 

After you download it, you can drag them to your vault, and unzip the notes. It should create a new unzipped version as a normal folder. The zipped version can be deleted. 
And done! Now you have a base with all the domain cards! I apologize id the properties are a mess. 

As a sidenote, for those who don't know, at the top of the base you can create a new note, with the same properties, also allowing to add some. This makes it easy to create cards of your own that are immediately organized into the base. 

Good luck!
